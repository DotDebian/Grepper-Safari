# Grepper-Safari
A Grepper build made for Safari.

To install:
- Download Xcode
- Open the folder in Xcode
- Press the Start button (upper left tab)
- Wait for launch
- Go to Safari -> Preferences -> Advanced and tick the developers settings
- Go to Safari -> Development tab -> Tick Allow unsigned extensions on the bottom menu
- Go to Safari -> Preferences -> Extensions, enable Grepper. You'll also need to allow it to access all websites (click on the Grepper icon upper right on the browser)
- Done ! :)

I've done this for myself as I'm using Safari and not Chrome. I'm not responsible for any issues occuring with the extension, and I am not the owner of these sources.
Feel free to star.
